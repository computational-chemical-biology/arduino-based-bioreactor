# Arduino-based bioreactor project

Arduino-based bioreactor hardware and software settings

## Basic requirements

To adjust, adapt and/or transfer the code to the Arduino board, the following software is required:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

> For this project, version 2.1.1 was used.

In terms of hardware, the following are required:

- 2 peristaltic pumps (flow rate 450 ml/min)
- 1 Arduino UNO board
- 1 breadboard
- 2 5V relay modules
- autoclavable silicone tubings
- 3 500ml reagent bottles
- jumper wires
- air compressor for aquarium (flow rate 1.5 L/min)
- 0.22 Âµm membrane filters
- Raspberry Pi board (any model)

## Software code

The code used in the project can be found in the ["software-code"](https://github.com/joaovitorgferreira/arduino-based-bioreactor/blob/main/software-code) and ["raspberry-code"](https://github.com/joaovitorgferreira/arduino-based-bioreactor/blob/main/raspberry-code) files.

## Hardware structure

The general structure of the hardware is exemplified in the image below.
